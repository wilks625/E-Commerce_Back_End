# Project Name:  
E-Commerce Back End  
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)  

## Description

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms is beneficial to a full-stack web developer.  
  

This repo is the back end of an e-commerce website which was created by configuring a working Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application allows the user to view, add, update, and delete categories, products, and tags.
